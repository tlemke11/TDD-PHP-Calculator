My Goal for this project is to successfully use TDD for the first time in a familiar setting.

Here are my BDD items:

1. The user can give the calculator unlimited numbers and add them all together.

2. The user can give the calculator unlimited numbers and multiply them all together.

3. The user can give the calculator unlimited numbers and divide them all.

4. The user can give the calculator unlimited numbers and subtract them all.
